# Creational Patterns

Provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

The patterns include : <br/>
## Builder Pattern 
Lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.
## Singleton Pattern
Lets you ensure that a class has only one interface
## Factory Method
Provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
## Abstract Factory
Lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
## Prototype Pattern
Lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependant on those codes classes.
