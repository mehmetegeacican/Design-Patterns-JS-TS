# Structural Design Patterns

Structural design patterns delve in assembling objects and classes into larger structures while maintainging flexibility and efficiency.<br/>
These patterns include: <br/>
## Adapter
Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate
## Bridge
Lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be developed independently of each other.
## Composite
Lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.
## Decorator
Lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.
## Facade
Provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, classes or any other subsystem.
## Flyweight
Lets you minimize memory usage by sharing some of the objects data with similar objects
## Proxy
Lets you provide a substitute or placeholder for another object.
