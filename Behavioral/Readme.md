# Behavioral Design Patterns
Behavioral Design patterns focus on algorithms and the relations between objects and classes. Increases efficiency in object communication and behaviours between objects. <br/>
These design patterns include: <br/>

## Command
This design pattern turns a request into a stand-aone object that contains all information about the request. This transformation lets you pass requests as a method arguments, delay or queue a request's execution, and support undoable operations.
## Iterator
This design pattern lets you traverse elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation(list,stack,tree...)
## Mediator
This design pattern lets you reduce chaotic dependencies between objects. The patter restricts direct communications between objects and forces them to collaborate only via a mediator object
## Memento
Memento is a design pattern that lets you save and restore the previous state of an object without revealing detailed information about it regarding its structure, algorithms etc.
## Observer
Defines a subscription mechanism that alerts and informs multiple objects (subscribers) about events that was published( any event that happended)(Pubsub mechanism)
## State
Allows an object to alter its behaviour when its internal state changes. The object acts according to the principles of a Finite State Machines
## Strategy
Defines various algorithms in separate classes and allow their objects to manipulated by other algorithms as well (make objects interchangeable)
## Visitor
Separates algorithms from the object structure that they operate.
