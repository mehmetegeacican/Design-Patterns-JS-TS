# Behavioral Design Patterns
Behavioral design patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
These design patterns include: <br/>

## Command
This design pattern turns a request into a stand-aone object that contains all information about the request. This transformation lets you pass requests as a method arguments, delay or queue a request's execution, and support undoable operations.
## Iterator
This design pattern lets you traverse elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation(list,stack,tree...)
## Mediator
This design pattern lets you reduce chaotic dependencies between objects. The patter restricts direct communications between objects and forces them to collaborate only via a mediator object
## Memento
This design pattern lets you save and restore the previous state of an object without revealing the details of its implementation.
## Observer
This design pattern lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing
## State
Lets an object alter its behavior when its internal state changes. It appears as if the object changed its class
## Strategy
Lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable
## Visitor
Lets you separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate.
