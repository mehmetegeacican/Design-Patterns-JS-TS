# Behavioral Design Patterns
Behavioral Design patterns focus on algorithms and the relations between objects and classes. Increases efficiency in object communication and behaviours between objects. <br/>
These design patterns include: <br/>

## Command
Turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. This transformation lets you pass requests as a method arguments, delay,queue,undo a requestâ€™s execution
## Iterator
Lets you traverse elements of a collection without
revealing its structure(list,stack,tree)
## Mediator
Lets you reduce chaotic dependencies between objects.
The pattern prohibits direct communication between objects and forces them to connect only by a mediator
## Memento
Lets you save and restore the previous state of an object without revealing detailed information about it regarding its structure, algorithms etc.
## Observer
Defines a subscription mechanism that alerts and informs multiple objects (subscribers) about events that was published( any event that happended)(Pubsub mechanism)
## State
Allows an object to alter its behaviour when its internal state changes. The object acts according to the principles of a Finite State Machines
## Strategy
Defines various algorithms in separate classes and allow their objects to manipulated by other algorithms as well (make objects interchangeable)
## Visitor
Separates algorithms from the object structure that they operate.
