# Memento
Memento is a design pattern that lets you save and restore the previous state of an object without revealing its structure,detailed implementation
## Problem
How to make a copy of the objectâ€™s private state? How to solve this tricky situation that occurs due to the encapsulation?
## Solution

## Structure
<li> 1: Originator -> produces snapsots of its own state, as well as restoring its state when snapshots are required </li>
<li> 2: Memento -> A snapshot of the originator's state. </li>
<li> 3: Caretaker -> Decides When and why the snapshot should be captured, when the state should be restored </li>
<br/>
The memento class is nessed insde the orignator. This allows the originator to access the privately declared fields and methods of the memento, while the caretaker has limited access.
