# Design-Patterns-JS-TS
This project contains the implementations and notes on the design patterns. Javascript and Typescript is  used as language.

# What is a Design Pattern?
<li>Design patterns are common solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design.</li>
<li> They can be thought of like a blueprint. A blueprint to solve a problem recurringly appearing in the code.</li>
<li>The pattern is not a specific piece of code, but a general concept for solving a particular problem </li>
<li> Patterns are used to implement a solution that suits the requirements of your own program. </li>

## Comparison with Algorithms
<li>Think of algorithms like a cooking recipe. Clear steps to achieve the goal and ORDERED!!!</li>
<li>Think of Design Patterns are like blueprints. Clear steps to achieve the goal. you can see what the result and its features are, but the exact order of implementation is up to you!!</li>

# Pattern Types

## Creational
These patterns focuses on object creation and increases flexibility and reusability of object creations.
## Behavioral
These patterns focuses on algorithms and the relations between objects and classes. Increases efficiency in object communication and behaviours between objects.
## Structural
These patterns delves in assembling objects and classes into larger structures while maintainging flexibility and efficiency.
