# Design-Patterns-JS-TS
This project contains the implementations and notes on the design patterns. Javascript and Typescript is  used as language.

# What is a Design Pattern?
<li>Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design.</li>
<li> They can be thought of like a blueprint. A blueprint to solve a problem recurringly appearing in the code.</li>
<li>The pattern is not a specific piece of code, but a general concept for solving a particular problem </li>
<li> Patterns are used to implement a solution that suits the requirements of your own program. </li>

## Comparison with Algorithms
<li>Think of algorithms like a cooking recipe. Clear steps to achieve the goal and ORDERED!!!</li>
<li>Design Patterns are like blueprints. Clear steps to achieve the goal. you can see what the result and its features are, but the exact order of implementation is up to you!!</li>

# Pattern Types

## Creational
These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
## Behavioral
These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
## Structural
These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
