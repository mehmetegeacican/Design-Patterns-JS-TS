# Design-Patterns-JS-TS
This project contains the implementations and notes on the design patterns.

# What is a Design Pattern?
<li>Design patterns are common solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design.</li>
<li> They can be thought of like a blueprint. A general concept to solve a reoccurring problem in the code.</li>
<li>The pattern is not a specific piece of code, but a general concept for solving a particular problem </li>
<br/>

## Comparison with Algorithms
<li>Think of algorithms like a cooking recipe. Clear steps to achieve the goal and ORDERED!!!</li>
<li>Think of Design Patterns are like blueprints. Clear steps to achieve the goal. you can see the result and features,but the exact order of implementation is up to you!!</li>

# Pattern Types

## Creational
These patterns focuses on object creation and increases flexibility and reusability of object creations.
## Behavioral
These patterns focuses on algorithms and the relations between objects and classes. Increases efficiency in object communication and behaviours between objects.
## Structural
These patterns delves in assembling objects and classes into larger structures while maintainging flexibility and efficiency.
